Modifications to Sami2py from SAMI2-1.00
========================================

- The ability to scale the neutral atmosphere in which the ions form through direct modification of the exospheric neutral temperature for extreme solar minimum conditions, as discussed by Emmert et al [2010].
- The ability to switch between HWM93, HWM07, and HWM14 as a user option.
