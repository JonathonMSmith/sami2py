Modifications from SAMI2-1.00
========================================

- Update to the official release of NRLMSISe-00. https://map.nrl.navy.mil/map/pub/nrl/NRLMSIS/NRLMSISE-00/
- The ability to scale the neutral atmosphere in which the ions form through direct modification of the exospheric neutral temperature for extreme solar minimum conditions, as discussed by Emmert et al [2010].
- The ability to input a series of Fourier coefficients to describe the ExB drifts as a function of local time rather than use the Fejer-Scherliess model. Fejer-Scherliess remains the default model for drifts.
- The ability to switch between HWM93, HWM07, and HWM14 as a user option.  HWM14 is set as the default option.
